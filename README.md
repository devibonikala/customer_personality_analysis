## Problem Statement 🤔  
Businesses struggle to understand their customers at an individual level, making it difficult to offer personalized services and targeted promotions. Traditional methods of customer segmentation based on broad categories fail to capture **hidden patterns** in customer behavior.  

### **Key Questions Addressed in this Project:**  
🔹 Can we segment customers based on their purchasing behavior?  
🔹 What demographic features influence spending habits the most?  
🔹 How do customers respond to marketing campaigns?  
🔹 Can we predict whether a customer will respond to a future campaign?
